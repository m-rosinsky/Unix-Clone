# Unix-Clone
This repo is a personal learning project in which I attempt to create most common unix command line programs.

## Learning Objectives

What I hope to accomplish by undertaking this project:

- Write system code to familiarize myself with the Unix ecosystem and the C language.
- Write production-level code through Test Driven Development (TDD).
- Learn good practices for releasing versioned products

## Binaries to Write:

| Binary Name | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `bash` | Not Started |
| `ls` | Not Started |
| `cd` | Not Started |
| `pwd` | Not Started |
| `cp` | Not Started |
| `mv` | Not Started |
| `cat` | Not Started |
| `file` | Not Started |
| `find` | Not Started |

Many more will be added, but these are the starting few.
